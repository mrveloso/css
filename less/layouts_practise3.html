            <h2>JavaScript Basic</h2>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm
                scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a
                    value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it. <span class="variable">var x</span>
                </li>

                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
                    language, widely used for controlling web page behavior. <span class="variable">var x=10;</span>
                </li>

                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Data Type</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variable you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean <span class="variable">true</span> or
                    <span class="variable">false;</span> null - <span class="variable">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="variable">42</span> or <span class="variable">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="variable">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>                    Arrray - <span class="variable">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="variable">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>

                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want ot perform different actions for different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or condisitons that have been met. You can use conditional
                    statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statments: <span class="variable">if</span> a specified condition is true, block; <span class="variable">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test,
                    if the first condition is false; <span class="variable">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>

                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Loops</a> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
                    and first-class functions
                </li>

                <li class="li_main_content"><a href="">Functions</a> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side
                    versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web
                    browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
